Public demonstration of the following use cases through a systemaccounting function:
* financial value is a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector)-valued function of buyers & sellers [trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector)#Derivatives_of_position) [ownership-coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_coordinates) of goods & services they measure to have *[dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity)* throughout [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation)-defined, [curl-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics))standardized time-coordinates (t, curl-x, curl-y, curl-z)
* disambiguating *delivered* value from *expected* value by enforcing a [law of conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) of value & liability (information) eliminates the possibility of [socializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative) the [default risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)) of any individual, firm, or industry (difficult to avoid when an industry is [chartered](http://www.occ.gov/topics/licensing/index-licensing.html), [protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout), and [primarily depended upon](http://www.opensecrets.org/industries./) by a government requiring [election assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion))
* establishing the conditions studied by [combinatorial game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory) through [physics & data science](http://www.systemaccounting.org/physics_of_value) ends public dependency on such resources as [credit ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating), [quarterly filings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-Q), the Consumer Price Index ([CPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index)), and the Federal Reserve Economic Data ([FRED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Economic_Data)) platform
* producing a scientific measure of the equilibrium price of capital removes the ability of a [central authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) to manipulate the [price of lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate)
* contract fulfillment automation
* data visualization

This open-source project is intended to exploit the software engineering community's familiarity with data science to rapidly develop their capacity to describe an economy from the [viewpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry)) of a physicist. Software engineers may be expediently converted into PhD-level economic experts because they come equipped with the technology to efficiently approach the subject in a purely scientific manner. For example, one may avoid all the trivial complexities that currently plague the fields of economics & finance by delivering the following requirement in [Feature #2](https://github.com/systemaccounting/mxfactorial/issues/2) of the project, "A **[4D null vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Causal_structure)** of *risk-free* value is measured when the *db_time* **AND** *cr_time* properties of a **[transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics))** record receive datetime values from [a pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_algebra#Spacetime_split) of debiting & crediting users." Identifying for engineers how physical value (x, y, z) is [transmitted & received](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_dual#Four_dimensions) with [respect to time (t)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency) between [sellers (+1/2,−π,−π,−π)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector#Spacetime_rotations) and [buyers (−1/2,+π,+π,+π)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation) enables them to teach the public how physical value is therefore [***added*** with respect to time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem), a.k.a. the *time-value of money*, the *cost of money*, the *cost* or *price of capital*, etc. Adding to the project's **[list of features](https://github.com/systemaccounting/mxfactorial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Apublic+sort%3Acreated-asc)** is designed to foster enough interaction between engineers and the data model that a movement to eliminate nothing but [public ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) becomes generally accepted as possible *only* when it's precipitated by activism pursued—not in the streets where slogans, bottles, and rocks are blindly hurled at others who are equally frustrated with their economy, but on knowledge's frontier where math, science, and technology are used as tools to empower mankind's *movement in the cloud*.

To include the public & raise support, this systemacounting demo is built using the fully managed Google App Engine solution. Contributors who are new to the App Engine platform are invited to complete its brief [Hello World! & Guestbook](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/) tutorials before [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and submitting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Financial contributors may submit transactions from the [Financial Support](https://systemaccounting.nationbuilder.com/financial_endorsement) page. Details as of 2/17/2016:

Roadmap:
* Set up managed application & persistence layer
* Produce requirements for:
  * data models
  * publicly-accessible endpoints
  * mobile web client for transactions (write) 
  * mobile-enabled web client for visualizing economic activity (read) through the [Data Layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/datalayer) feature of the Google Maps Javascript API

**Note**: Both transaction and visualization clients will be strictly served by publicly-accessible endpoints to demonstrate for the U.S. Treasury that with enough security, anyone may build an app that submits transaction data to the public ledger, thereby eliminating "banks" from the [value transmission](http://www.systemaccounting.org/what_is_money) equation.
